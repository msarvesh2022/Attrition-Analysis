# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer data from a bank to identify the key factors that influence customer churn (whether a customer leaves the bank or not).  
By understanding these factors, the project aims to generate insights that can help improve customer retention strategies and reduce churn.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains customer-level information such as demographics, account balance, banking products, and churn status.

### Important Columns

- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is actively using bank services (Yes/No).  
- **EstimatedSalary**: Estimated annual salary of the customer.  
- **Exited**: Churn indicator (1 = Customer left, 0 = Customer stayed).  
- **Complain**: Whether the customer raised complaints (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
