## Overview 

Certainly Here is a clear and professional project description you can add to your README file
Customer Churn Analysis Web Application
This project is a web-based application designed to analyze and predict customer churn for a bank The application allows users to input customer data through a user-friendly form and receive predictions on whether a customer is likely to leave the bank The project leverages machine learning techniques to provide insights and help the bank take proactive measures to retain valuable customers
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end solution for customer churn prediction The application is built using Python and a web framework such as Flask The machine learning model is trained on historical customer data and deployed as part of the web application
Key Features

- User-friendly web interface for data input
- Real-time churn prediction based on user input
- Display of relevant customer information and prediction results
- Information page describing each input feature
- Modern and responsive UI design
- 
Project Workflow
1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
The project begins with collecting and cleaning customer data This includes handling missing values encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features The cleaned data is then used to train the machine learning model

2 Model Training
A suitable machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression random forest or gradient boosting is selected and trained on the preprocessed data The model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure good predictive performance
3 Web Application Development
The web application is developed using Flask The app provides a form for users to enter customer details and submit them for prediction The backend processes the input data applies the same preprocessing steps as during training and uses the trained model to predict churn
4 User Interface and Experience
The frontend is designed with HTML and CSS to ensure a clean and intuitive user experience The application includes an information page that explains each input feature to help users understand the data being entered
5 Deployment
The completed application is prepared for deployment on Google Cloud Platform using App Engine The necessary configuration files such as requirements.txt and app.yaml are created The app is deployed to the cloud making it accessible to users via a web browser
